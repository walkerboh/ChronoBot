# ChronoBot
A new Discord bot for gaming deals!

## Supported APIs
+ [Chrono.gg](https://www.chrono.gg) Sale API
+ [Chrono.gg](https://www.chrono.gg) Shop API

## Planned APIs
Actual integrations to be determined
+ [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com)
+ Steam
+ [Meh](https://meh.com/) - I know this one breaks form from gaming related APIs, so unsure yet.

This bot is still in early development and is not yet public. A public release is planned after the ChronoGG commands are mostly stabilized, and possibly a rename for the bot.
