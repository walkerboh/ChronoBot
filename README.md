# WheatlyBot
A new Discord bot for gaming deals!
Prefix: $

## Supported APIs
+ [Chrono.gg](https://www.chrono.gg) Sale API
  + $sale - Shows the current sale
  + $autosale - Toggles showing new sales in the channel.
  + $autostatus - Displays the current autosale status.
+ [Chrono.gg](https://www.chrono.gg) Shop API
  + $shop (n) - Displays all the items in the coin shop. If supplied a number, will display the details of that item from the list.
  
## Planned APIs
Actual integrations to be determined
+ [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com)
+ Steam
+ [Meh](https://meh.com/) - I know this one breaks form from gaming related APIs, so unsure yet.

This bot is still in early development and is not yet public. A public release is planned after the ChronoGG commands are mostly stabilized.
